Service Counter/Restaurant cellphone-based pager implemented with twilio.

Have you been to a restaurant and been given one of those bulky pagers and wondered why they didn't just use the cellphone you already had on you? Have you been to a service counter where they used your cellphone for paging and wished you had a similar service? Then this is the app for you!

## Components ##

There are three main components to the app. 

1. Concierge screen: allows for checkin points where name and cellphone are gathered. For service counters, you can get what the problem is in case you want to dedicate folks to handling specific types of problems and they will work through that list.
2. Worker screen: simplified without the info gathering form.
3. Status screen: Allows displaying an average wait screen and the list of people you're waiting to come up after you've paged them. This screen is handy so that people can visually confirm they've been paged or for those who just like to stare at a status screen. It only shows first name and last 4 digits of phone number for privacy reasons.
